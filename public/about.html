        <h2>Projects</h2>
         <h3>Portfolio Website (Python - Flask) </h3>
         <ul>
            <li>Developed a dynamic personal portfolio website using the Flask framework to showcase projects and handle user interactions. Utilised GitHub to keep track of changes.</li>
            <li>Implemented routing for multiple HTML pages and created a contact form that captures user input and stores it in a database of CSV file format.</li>
            <li>Built back-end logic in Python to manage form submissions, error handling, and data persistence.</li>
         </ul>

         <h3>Food Court Management System (Java)</h3>
         <ul>
            <li>Developed an OOP based GUI Java application using Swing to streamline food ordering, connecting Vendors, Customers, Runners, Admins, and Managers. </li>
            <li>The system improved the order processing time by up to 60% faster, inventory management improved by 70-80%, sales reporting and analytics by 90%. </li>
            <li>Stored data in text files and applied exception handling (error management) for reliability.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Detecting Fraud Transactions using Data Structures and Algorithms (C++)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Developed a core data management module for a Financial Fraud Detection System in C++, leveraging a procedural approach with singly linked lists for efficient transaction handling.</li>
            <li>Engineered a strategic integration solution to seamlessly merge this module with an existing object-oriented codebase, effectively resolving complex compilation conflicts and ensuring cohesive system functionality.</li>
            <li>Collaborated effectively on a team project, utilizing Git/GitHub for version control to manage diverse code contributions and deliver a unified, functional application.</li>
