<h1>Personal movie rankings </h1>
<h2>Top 3 so far</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Rush</h3>
<p>Tbh its sucha nice and inspirational movie, 
    especially for probably one with a lower budget</p>

<h3>Ford vs Ferrari</h3>
<p>I like this one too</p>

<h3>The internship</h3>
<p>Low-key gives hope that you should think out of the box</p>
